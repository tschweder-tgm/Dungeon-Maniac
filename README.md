### About the Game
Forked game from<https://github.com/horstjens/pyrogue>
<br>
Our goal is to extend the open-source project HorstJens made with our own ideas
and learn how to work with an open-source project in Python.

It is a roguelike-game inspired by different Dungeon Crawler games and most notably
the name-giving game Rogue from the 1980s

While the game is already pretty substantial with its core gameplay 
mechanics, but we thought about adding something of our own.
