### About the Game
Forked game from <https://github.com/horstjens/pyrogue>
<br>
Our goal is to extend the open-source project made by HorstJens with our own ideas
and learn how to work on an open-source project in Python.

It is a Roguelike-game inspired by different Dungeon Crawler games and most notably
the name-giving game Rogue from the 1980s

While the game already has pretty well developed core gameplay 
mechanics, we still wanted to add something of our own.
